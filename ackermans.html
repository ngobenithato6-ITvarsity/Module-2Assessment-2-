                  <p>In light of the recent countrywide lock-down which commences at midnight on the 26th March our RSA stores will be closed for 21-days as laid out by President Cyril Ramaphosa’s address earlier this week.

Our first priority is the health and safety of our staff and of our customers. We thank you for your understanding and commitment to Ackermans during these unprecedented times. We are certain that as a company and a nation we will survive and emerge from this – STRONGER TOGETHER!

Ackermans is defined by our purpose of bringing value to life for all stakeholders and now is the time to demonstrate our passion and to live true to this purpose.

All of our staff nationwide have been put on paid leave for the duration of the countrywide lock-down and will remain at home until it is the right time to open the stores.</p>
